# LeetCodeSolution
Milestones for what i have learned sofar. Put the knowledge into practice, sharpen skills.

This is Thien, from VNUHCM - University of Sience, i'm currently first year at college.
Above is my solutions for some tasks in leetcode - a good page for learning as well as practicing, which i was recommended by both my friends and teachers.

My source codes are probably not the best solutions out there, so you can improve it yourself, cuz i'm new to this major.

Thank you for have a look. Have a nice day myfriends!
